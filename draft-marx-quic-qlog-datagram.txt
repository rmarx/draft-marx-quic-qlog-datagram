Abstract

   This document describes qlog data type definitions for both the QUIC
   Datagram Frame defined in [RFC9221] and the HTTP/3 Datagram Frame

1.  Introduction

   This document describes qlog data type definitions for both the QUIC
   Datagram Frame defined in [RFC9221] and the HTTP/3 Datagram Frame
   defined in [RFC9297].  These data types are intended for use within
   event definitions defined in [QLOG-QUIC] and [QLOG-HTTP3].

   This document extends the $QuicFrame extension point defined in
   [QLOG-QUIC] and the $HTTPFrame extension point defined in
   [QLOG-HTTP3].  It also defines how to log a QUIC transport parameter
   for indicating QUIC datagram support, as well as an HTTP/3 setting to
   indicate HTTP/3 datagram support.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The event and data structure definitions in ths document are
   expressed in the Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL] and its
   extensions described in [QLOG-MAIN].

   The following fields from [QLOG-MAIN] are imported and used: data and
   RawInfo.

3.  QUIC Datagrams

   qlog support for QUIC Datagram frames consists of two aspects:

   *  support for logging the max_datagram_frame_size QUIC transport
      parameter

   *  support for logging the type, length and contents of the DATAGRAM
      frame itself

3.1.  max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter

   Support for the QUIC Datagram extension defined in [RFC9221] is
   signaled using the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter,
   defined in Section 3 of [RFC9221].

   If utilized, this transport parameter MUST be logged as a field of
   the transport:parameters_set event defined in [QLOG-QUIC], more
   specifically:

   TransportParametersSet = {
       ? max_datagram_frame_size: uint64
       * text => any
   }

             Figure 1: TransportParametersSet extended with the
                     max_datagram_frame_size parameter

3.2.  QUICDatagramFrame Definition

   This section describes a qlog data type that can be used to log the
   contents of the QUIC DATAGRAM frame defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC9221].

   The $QuicFrame extension point defined in [QLOG-QUIC] is utilized to
   link the QUICDatagramFrame type to the existing qlog data types.

   QUICDatagramFrame = {
       frame_type: "datagram"
       ? length: uint64
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

   $QuicFrame /= QUICDatagramFrame

                   Figure 2: QUICDatagramFrame definition

4.  HTTP/3 Datagrams

   qlog support for HTTP/3 Datagram frames consists of two aspects:

   *  support for logging the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM HTTP/3 setting

   *  support for logging the type and contents of the HTTP/3 DATAGRAM
      frame itself

4.1.  SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting

   Support for the HTTP/3 Datagram extension defined in [RFC9297] is
   signaled using the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting, defined in
   Section 2.1.1 of [RFC9297].

   If utilized, this setting MUST be logged as a field of the
   HTTPSetting data type defined in [QLOG-HTTP3], more specifically:

   HTTP3DatagramSetting = {
       name: "SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM"
       value: 0 / 1
   }

          Figure 3: HTTPSetting instance for SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM

4.2.  HTTPDatagramFrame Definition

   This section describes a qlog data type that can be used to log the
   contents of the HTTP/3 DATAGRAM frame defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC9297].

   The $HTTPFrame extension point defined in [QLOG-HTTP3] is utilized to
   link the HTTPDatagramFrame type to the existing qlog data types.

   HTTPDatagramFrame = {
       frame_type: "datagram"
       quarter_stream_id: uint64
       ? raw: RawInfo
   }

   $HTTPFrame /= HTTPDatagramFrame

                   Figure 4: HTTPDatagramFrame definition

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   The security and privacy considerations discussed in [QLOG-MAIN]
   apply to this document as well.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
